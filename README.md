# Secure DataC ontainer
SecureDataContainer <E> is a container of type E objects. Intuitively the collection behaves like
a Data Storage species for data storage and sharing (represented in the simulation by
type E objects). The collection must guarantee a data security mechanism by providing its own
user identity management mechanism. Furthermore, the collection must provide a mechanism for
access control that allows the data owner to perform a selective restriction
access to your data included in the collection. Some users may be authorized by the owner
to access the data, while others cannot access it without authorization.
